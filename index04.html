This fully automated continuous line system performs high-speed, high-precision roll-to-roll coating and drying of paper, films, foils, and membranes. The slot die coating head ensures superior stability and reproducibility in coating quality. The RS Coater head also supports irregular shape coating, intermittent coating, and additional functionality such as lamination and slitting during coating or drying.

The slot die was designed based on fluid analysis and backed by Chugai Ro's extensive experience.
<span style="color: red;">Our unique highly sealed chamber structure allows for coating even in environments with a low dew point (-70°C or below) and N2 environments!</span>

<span style="color: red;">The equipment doesn’t use a dew point cover, making it easier to handle substrates and significantly reducing coating material used in environments with low dew points.</span>

<h4>Continuous Die Coater</h4>
This system unwinds and performs continuous coating of rolled substrates, such as paper, film and foil. The design makes use of a slot die which has been incorporated in line with the results of fluid analysis as well as ample real-world success.
